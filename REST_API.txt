Got it ðŸš€ Letâ€™s turn all that heavy REST API theory into beautiful, structured notes that are:

Easy to understand

Simple to revise before interviews

ðŸ“˜ REST API â€” Quick Notes for Interview
ðŸ”¹ What is an API?

API = Application Programming Interface

Defines rules for communication between software systems.

Example: A timesheet app exposes an API â†’ You send employee details â†’ It returns hours worked.

Think of API as a bridge between client and server resources.

ðŸ”¹ What is REST?

REST = Representational State Transfer

Itâ€™s an architectural style (not a protocol).

Defines how APIs should behave to enable reliable communication over the web.

REST APIs commonly use HTTP as the protocol.

ðŸ‘‰ REST (design style) â‰  HTTP (communication protocol), but they work together.

ðŸ”¹ REST API (RESTful API)

An API built using REST principles.

Communication between client and server using HTTP methods.

Data format: Mostly JSON (but can be XML, HTML, images, etc.).

ðŸ”¹ Clients & Resources

Clients â†’ Who makes requests (browser, mobile app, software).

Resources â†’ The data client wants (text, image, video, JSON, etc.).

Server â†’ Provides the resource and manages security/authentication.

ðŸ”¹ CRUD Operations with HTTP
CRUD Action	HTTP Method	Example
Create	POST	Add a new user
Read	GET	Fetch user details
Update	PUT / PATCH	Update user info
Delete	DELETE	Remove user
ðŸ”¹ REST Principles (Key Interview Point âœ…)

Uniform Interface

Use a standard format for communication.

Constraints:

Resources identified by URI

Self-descriptive messages (metadata included)

Hyperlinks for discovering related resources (HATEOAS)

Statelessness

Each request is independent (server doesnâ€™t remember previous requests).

Clients send all necessary info with every request.

Layered System

Requests/responses may pass through multiple servers (layers) like security, load balancers, etc.

Client doesnâ€™t know about intermediate layers.

Cacheability

Responses can be cached for performance.

Example: Common images, headers, etc. are stored instead of re-downloading every time.

Code on Demand (Optional)

Server can send executable code (e.g., JavaScript for form validation).

ðŸ”¹ Why REST APIs?

Scalable â†’ Works well with large systems.

Portable â†’ Easy to use across platforms.

Flexible â†’ Can send data in JSON, XML, etc.

Widely used â†’ Industry standard for web services.

ðŸ”¹ Real-World Example

A banking app â†’ needs to fetch user balance (GET), update profile (PUT), delete old payees (DELETE), or add transactions (POST).

REST API provides these operations securely over HTTP.

ðŸŽ¯ Interview Cheat-Sheet

Q: What is REST API in simple terms?
ðŸ‘‰ REST API is a way for two systems (client & server) to talk over the web using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Itâ€™s stateless, scalable, and usually returns JSON data.

Q: Difference between REST and HTTP?
ðŸ‘‰ REST is an architectural style (rules for API design). HTTP is the protocol (rules for communication). REST APIs often use HTTP, but they are not the same.

Q: What are the principles of REST?
ðŸ‘‰ Uniform interface, Statelessness, Layered system, Cacheability, Code on demand (optional).

Q: Example of CRUD operations with REST API?
ðŸ‘‰ GET â†’ Fetch users, POST â†’ Add user, PUT â†’ Update user, DELETE â†’ Remove user.

âš¡ With these notes, you can answer REST API questions confidently in interviews â€” short, structured, and with real-world examples.

Would you like me to also make a small diagram/visual flow (Client â†’ HTTP Request â†’ Server â†’ JSON Response) that you can put in your notes for quick recall?
